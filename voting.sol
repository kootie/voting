Here's a breakdown of the code:

We declare the VotingSystem contract with state variables, including an owner address, a totalVotes counter, and a mapping to store information about registered voters.

We define a Voter struct to keep track of whether a voter is registered and has voted.

We create two modifiers:

onlyOwner: Ensures that only the contract owner can call certain functions.
onlyRegisteredVoter: Ensures that only registered voters can interact with voting-related functions.
In the constructor, we set the owner to the address that deploys the contract.

The registerVoter function allows the contract owner to register new voters by adding their addresses to the voters mapping.

The vote function allows registered voters to cast their votes, and it increments the totalVotes counter.

The getVoteCount function allows anyone to retrieve the current vote count.

To deploy this contract on the Swisstronik testnet, you would need to use a development environment like Remix or a command-line tool like Truffle. You would also need testnet Ether for deployment and transactions.
